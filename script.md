# Vanquishing Deployment Dragons with Nx wizardry

## Storyteller

Hark, dear companions of wonder, gather 'round this enchanted realm. 
I am known as Miro, a humble wanderer of Nx tales, and it is with the honor of monorepo ages, that I shall unfold this tale and reveal thy secrets. Let us embark upon a journey through the realms of knowledge and imagination, where every step we take is a step deeper into the magic of Nx. So, with open hearts and curious minds, let our adventure commence!

## The kingdom

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far far away, there stood a grand castle surrounded by a shimmering lake. This castle was no ordinary castle; it was a castle of wonders and secrets, guarded by the most viscous dragons you could ever imagine.

In the lack of intruders, once noble, they fell into idleness and greed. No longer soaring in the skies, they turned to extortion, demanding tributes from fearful deployment chariots. Their lairs overflowed with stolen treasures, and the kingdom despaired waiting for a hero to end their reign of greed.

## The dragons

You see, these dragons had a peculiar fondness for a show involving one called "Tim Robinson" on their enchanted Netflix, and they despised any interruptions while they were in the middle of their binging sessions.

Each day, as the young deliveryman, 5-7, crossed the reclining bridge to the castle, the dragons confronted him:

"Who dares to interrupt our Netflix and Chill?" growled one of the dragons.
"It's me, 5-7," he replied timidly.
"Who?" questioned another dragon.
"The black night, the delivery lad. I need to deploy these boxes to the castle," he explained.
"You are being too rough on the rope," one dragon complained.
"You have to pay the bridge toll," threatened the other.

With a heavy heart, 5-7 handed over the gold he had earned, desperately needed by the dragons for their TV subscription.

"I think you should leave", said the dragon heads in unison

Little did anyone know, these were indeed the dark ages, and subscriptions were a luxury beyond measure, just like their underwater TV.

## Bridge over the troubled water

The kingdom found itself in dire straits. They sought a savior to quell the dragon menace. Since the day the fabled 5-8 delivery man vanished to Korea, shipments remained taxxed, trapped in the grip of the dragons' tyranny.

Many had attempted to breach the perilous dragon territory. They rushed across bridges, urged their horses into turbo-charged gallops, ventured under the moon's shroud, and even conversed in the Norwegian and wearing a different pair of pants. Alas, every effort proved futile, for the dragons remained unyielding, their fiery gaze undiminished.

## The hero

Meanwhile, in a quaint village just outside the castle, there lived a young lad. He was larger, stronger, and smarter than the rest of the villagers, yet he possessed a kind heart. He had just completed a boot camp at the local shoemaker's guild and was in search of a job. He dreamt of becoming the castle's next deliveryman, but he knew nothing about the complicated world of deployments.

His days were spent sipping on his favorite drink at the local tavern and whistling Flume's tunes in the sad key of D minor.

## The old man and the water

One day, an elderly man entered the tavern, parched and in need of a drink.

"Scussi, scussi…" he muttered, but everyone ignored him, except for our young lad. He kindly offered the man a sip of his drink.

"Grazie! I left my wallet at el segando," the old man confessed.

"Might I humbly ask thee, dear friend, for a morsel of that fare thou dost enjoy?", the man gestured toward the square, thick doughy meal on the table.

"My pizza? Of course fair traveller," the lad replied.

"Doth not resemble the pizza…" the old man began but quickly realized he shouldn't question a gift horse. When the meal was over, the man thanked the young lad and offered to help him in return.

"What's troubling you? Perhaps I can help," the old men inquired.

The youth spun tale of mighty dragons, daring deployments, and the nefarious ways of racketeering.

### The book

He did not know, the elderly man hailed from the slopes of South Tyrol, renowned throughout the land as a wizard of the highest order, a master of ancient arts known as Nx. The old man revealed a mysterious book, the Book of Nx, said to contain the most potent magic in the entire development world. Thou looking brand new, one could feel millenia of knowledge within it. Its pages were blank, and there was no author's name, only the initials "AI" on the cover.

"It's magical," the old man explained, "ask it a question, and it will answer."

He thought about the dragons, how they delayed shipments, and how they loved to watch their shows undisturbed. He asked the book, "How do I speed up the deployment process?"

The book's answer was simple: "When you come to the bridge, look upon the clouds and say the magical words 'Nx affected,' and all unnecessary boxes will disappear."

The lad put this knowledge to the test, and it worked like a charm. The bridge operators were astonished, and they immediately informed the king. Impressed by the lad's ingenuity, the king rewarded him with a chest of gold and sent him on his way.

## The broken circle

As time passed, the wheels on the delivery carriage would often break, and the guards struggled to fix them. 
"This devilish circle seems to be ever prone to vexing disruptions."
However after fixing the wheel, when they shouted "Nx affected," they realized that the boxes had disappeared. It turned out that the "Nx affected" spell assumed successful past delivery and did not try to deliver the missing boxes again.

Once more, they summoned the young developer and asked him how to ensure the "affected" spell worked only on the boxes that were genuinely affected.

"Use 'set-shas' before you call 'affected.' This will make sure no failed deliveries are skipped over," advised the mysterious Book of Nx.

With this solution in hand, the king was satisfied and generously rewarded the lad once again.

## The lock

However, the kingdom faced another challenge. To gather their necessary enchantments from distant realms, iStrudel sought the coveted "Pink Lady," while iJuice thirsted for the allure of "Golden Delicious" from neighboring kingdoms.

They kept a locked file with crucial information about the items, sp whenever they changed an item, they had to ship only the affected product.

After a string of triumphant deployments that echoed through the kingdom, they set their sights on grander horizons. It was then that they summoned a new Chief Deployment Officer, for they sought to weave even more magical wonders into their endeavors. As any manager would do in their quest for order and control, he ushered a new processes upon them. He conjured a new custom build script, altered the keys that kept the lock sealed and marked their precious artifacts with ever-evolving versions. Unfortunately, the "Nx affected" spell ceased to work yet again for the boxes had all been altered.

In desperation, they called upon the young man once more.

## External dependencies

He asked the Book of Nx, "How can I ensure the 'affected' spell works, depending on the content, and only ships the boxes truly affected by external items?"

"Mark each box's build with a list of external dependencies and cross-check with your locked file," the book replied.

Following these instructions, the kingdom was once again able to use the "affected" spell for their shipments. The king was delighted, and the young assistant was richly rewarded.

## The pruning

But the challenges didn't end there. In the vast tapestry of kingdoms, each pursued its own path, crafting enchantments unlike those of their fellow realms. Some chose to adorn their creations with windows, while others wove entirely unixs spells. You would not believe, in the most peculiar of kingdoms, carriages bore a coachmen's seat upon the right side!

To bridge this wondrous diversity, they devised a magical scroll to record the elements required for each installation, a scroll named "JSON" in homage to the ingenious Douglas who birthed the idea. Yet, their knowledge reached not the depths of these external items' interdependence, thus they bundled all foreign artifacts, bearing the weight of slowness upon their quest.

They called upon the young lad once more.
  
"How can we ensure only the subset of our dependencies is installed based on the package scroll?" he asked the Book of Nx.

"Encircle yer dependencies in the yarn spun by the devil's cat, and with a deft hand, prune away all but those allies recorded within thy package script. Then, with caution brew a potion with dragon's breath and enchanted bat powder, drenched in the waters from the world turned upside down... or, in a simpler jest, invoke the 'generateLockFile' incantation as you pack the enchanted boxes, and it shall conjure for thee the pruned scrolls of necessities."

With this piece of wisdom, the kingdom's deployments became faster and more efficient than ever before. 
"Hail the pruning" shouted the villagers, 

## The yarn and the helm

By this time, the dragons had sensed a curious disturbance, though it did not emerge from under the sea. The flow of payment, like the ancient tides, had grown stagnant, threatening their very livelihood. Dragons from distant realms flaunted their expanded domains, boasting of their newfound ability to partake in the enchantments of Netflix, Amazon, and Disney. The local dragons bore the brunt of ridicule among their kin. Action was imperative.

With sharpened ears and vigilant eyes, they resumed their watchful vigil over the shipments and, once again, intercepted the deliveries. The king, recognizing the young man's prowess, summoned him one last time.

"You have, with skill and wit, lessened our shipments and banished the woes of broken wheels. You've steered us away from importing extraneous treasures and crafted package manifests locked in secrets. Yet, our deployments linger at a tortoise's pace, ripe for interception by the dragons," the king declared. "If you unravel this final enigma, I shall anoint you as my official delivery envoy and grant thee treasures beyond measure."

Turning to the mystical pages of his book, the young man sought wisdom on hastening deployments and ensuring their integrity.

"To speed forth your deployments and unite them as one," the book whispered, "you must dock all items and enshroud them within a sealed chest, save them to cloud of Nx wisdom, and bound to a magical artifactory from the land of jFrog. Then embark upon a journey to a realm where DevOps titans dwell. There, cunningly blend in by inquiring about the merits of Jenkins against Azure. In a moment of distraction, seize one of their precious Kubernetes helms. With this helm, your deployments shall be invincible."

## The happy ever after

And so, he embarked on this mystical quest, following each step with unwavering resolve. In the end, he triumphed over the dragons and ascended to the cherished role of the kingdom's chief deployment sage.

As for the dragons, they surrendered their dreams of free entertainment and embarked on a different path. They journeyed northward, where they joined a franchise on "How to Train Your Dragon," contentedly embracing their newfound purpose in the world of storytelling. Thus, a harmonious tale unfolded, and all found their own enchanted endings in the grand tapestry of the kingdom.
